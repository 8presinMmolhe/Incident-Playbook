If you want to install apps on your iPhone that are not available on the App Store, you can use a plugin system called Blucher Zip. This is a zip file that contains the app files and a script that will transfer them to your iPhone's root directory. You can use ZiPhone, a popular tool for jailbreaking and unlocking iPhones, to install Blucher Zip on your device.
 
Here are the steps to follow:

1. Download ZiPhone from [https://github.com/Zibri/ZiPhone](https://github.com/Zibri/ZiPhone) and unzip it on your computer.
2. Download the app you want to install and zip it on a Unix system (such as a Mac, Linux, or Cygwin under Windows) with the command: `zip -yr9 Blucher.zip /Applications/YOURAPP.APP`. You can also add a script file named `/tmp/Blucher.sh` to the zip file if you want to run some commands after or instead of installation.
3. Connect your iPhone to your computer and launch ZiPhone. If your iPhone is not jailbroken yet, use the "DO IT ALL" option. Otherwise, use the "JAILBREAK" option.
4. Copy the Blucher.zip file to `/var/root/Media/Blucher.zip` or `/var/mobile/Media/Blucher.zip` on your iPhone's filesystem using an SSH client or a file manager app.
5. Reboot your iPhone and wait for ZiPhone to install Blucher Zip. You will see a big red WARNING message on your iPhone during installation.
6. After installation is complete, you should see the app icon on your iPhone's home screen. Enjoy!

Note: ZiPhone and Blucher Zip are not official or supported by Apple. Use them at your own risk. ZiPhone will not be responsible for any 3rd party plugins. Always backup your data before using these tools.
  
## Why Use Blucher Zip?
 
Blucher Zip is a convenient and flexible way to install apps on your iPhone that are not available on the App Store. You can use it to install apps that are customized, modified, or developed by third-party developers. You can also use it to install apps that are not compatible with your iPhone's firmware version or region. For example, you can install apps that require an older firmware version, or apps that are only available in certain countries.

Blucher Zip also allows you to run shell scripts on your iPhone, which can be useful for performing various tasks or modifications. For example, you can use a script to change your iPhone's settings, backup or restore your data, fix errors, or tweak your system. You can also use a script to install multiple apps at once, or to uninstall Blucher Zip itself.
 
## What Are the Risks of Using Blucher Zip?
 
Blucher Zip is not an official or supported tool by Apple. It is a third-party plugin that uses ZiPhone, a jailbreaking and unlocking tool, to access your iPhone's root directory. This means that using Blucher Zip can void your warranty, expose your device to security risks, or cause instability or damage to your system. You should always backup your data before using Blucher Zip, and use it at your own risk.
 
Blucher Zip also depends on the quality and compatibility of the apps and scripts that you install. Some apps or scripts may not work properly on your iPhone, or may conflict with other apps or system files. Some apps or scripts may also contain malicious code that can harm your device or steal your information. You should always verify the source and reputation of the apps and scripts that you install, and avoid installing anything that you don't trust.
