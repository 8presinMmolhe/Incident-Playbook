##  NVIDIA GeForce 8500 GT Performance 
 
NVIDIA GeForce 8500 GT is a mid-range graphics card that can handle some games and applications at low to medium settings. However, it is not suitable for modern games that require high graphics performance and DirectX 11 or higher support. According to UserBenchmark, the GeForce 8500 GT averaged 99.2% lower than the peak scores attained by the group leaders. It also ranked 629th out of 699 GPUs tested.
 
The GeForce 8500 GT has a floating-point performance of 29.376 GFLOPS, which is very low compared to other cards in the same series. For example, the GeForce 8800 GT has a floating-point performance of 504 GFLOPS, which is more than 17 times higher than the GeForce 8500 GT[^2^]. The GeForce 8500 GT also has a low texture fill rate of 3.6 billion/sec and a low pixel fill rate of 1.8 billion/sec[^2^]. These factors limit the card's ability to render complex scenes and effects.
 
The GeForce 8500 GT can run some older games such as Half-Life 2, Doom 3, and Quake 4 at decent frame rates and resolutions. However, it struggles with newer games such as Crysis, Call of Duty 4, and BioShock, which require more graphics power and features. The card also does not support DirectX 10.1 or higher, which means it cannot run games that use advanced features such as tessellation, ambient occlusion, and depth of field[^3^].
